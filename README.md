# Synopsys scripts and Low-power post-synthesis plugin
Here are contained scripts I've written during a course of Synthesis and optimization of digital systems at Politecnico di Torino. \n
There is also the plugin I used to participate at the final contest of that course in the academic year 2017/2018. \n
With that script [`I managed to win the contest`]. Its performance were tested by me using several benchmark circuits like this one: http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jhayes/iscas.restore/c1908/c1908.html.
