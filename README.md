# Synopsys scripts and Low-power post-synthesis plugin
Here are contained scripts I've written during a course of Synthesis and optimization of digital systems at Politecnico di Torino. <br >
There is also the plugin I used to participate at the final contest of that course in the academic year 2017/2018.
With that script `I managed to win the contest`. I've tested its performance using several benchmark circuits like this one: http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jhayes/iscas.restore/c1908/c1908.html. The plugin and a script I used to test it are both under the `low_power_plugin` directory.
